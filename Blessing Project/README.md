# CSP Assignments Implementation Guide

**Author:** BLESSING KAMALEBO MABULAY  
**Class:** Computer Science Principles  
**Date:** January 2024  

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation for three CSP (Computer Science Principles) assignments from code.org. Each assignment builds upon the previous one, demonstrating increasing complexity and mastery of programming concepts.

## My Assignments

### 1. Data Visualisation Activity (Unit 5 Lesson 8)
**What I'm doing:** Creating meaningful data visualizations using code.org datasets
**Why this matters:** This assignment teaches me how to analyze real data and find patterns that are actually useful, not just obvious relationships.

**Key Requirements:**
- Show non-trivial patterns/trends (not just simple brand vs style)
- Provide justifications for all my decisions
- Address potential bias in data collection
- Add detailed comments explaining what my code does

**My Approach:** 
- I'll use code.org's data visualization tools
- Focus on relationships that reveal interesting insights
- Document why I filter data the way I do
- Think critically about where the data comes from

### 2. Interactive App with Random Elements (Unit 6 Lesson 8)
**What I'm doing:** Creating an interactive app that demonstrates random number generation and property manipulation
**Why this matters:** This teaches me about user interface design, event handling, and creating dynamic, engaging applications.

**Key Requirements:**
- Use random number generation
- Manipulate UI properties dynamically
- Handle user events and interactions
- Create an engaging user experience

**My Approach:**
- Build an app with changing shapes, colors, and positions
- Implement proper event handling for user interactions
- Use arrays and loops to manage multiple elements
- Ensure variety and unpredictability in the experience

### 3. Final App (Unit 6 Lesson 13)
**What I'm doing:** Open-ended project covering all coding structures we've studied
**Why this matters:** This is my chance to show everything I've learned and create something useful for students like me.

**Key Requirements:**
- At least 3 screens (I'm planning 5!)
- Cover all studied coding structures
- Submit code directly in code.org
- Extensive commenting throughout

**My Approach:**
- Build a comprehensive Student Task Manager app
- Demonstrate mastery of all programming concepts
- Create well-documented and commented code
- Make something that would actually help students

## My Coding Standards

### Comment Requirements
- **Extensive commenting:** Every few lines, if not every line
- **Explain the "why":** Not just what the code does, but why I chose this approach
- **Original design:** All onEvent, functions, traversals designed by me
- **External sources:** Only for specific syntax, properly cited
- **Justification:** Explain why each decision was made

## How I'm Using This Repository

### Step 1: Understanding the Requirements
I've created detailed guides for each assignment that explain:
- What I need to accomplish
- Why each requirement matters
- How to approach the problem
- What coding structures to demonstrate

### Step 2: Planning My Implementation
For each assignment, I:
- Read the requirements carefully
- Plan my approach before writing code
- Think about what would make a good user experience
- Consider how to demonstrate all the required coding structures

### Step 3: Writing My Code
I follow these principles:
- Start with a clear plan
- Add comments as I write code
- Test each feature as I implement it
- Make sure my code is readable and well-organized

### Step 4: Testing Everything
I use the test environment to:
- Verify all functionality works correctly
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Make sure the user experience is smooth
- Confirm all coding structures are properly demonstrated

### Step 5: Transferring to code.org
Once everything works in the test environment:
- Copy my code to the code.org platform
- Test again in the actual environment
- Make any necessary adjustments
- Submit my assignments

## My Learning Goals

Through these assignments, I want to demonstrate:

1. **Problem-Solving Skills:** I can break down complex problems into manageable pieces
2. **Programming Proficiency:** I understand and can use all the coding structures we've learned
3. **User-Centered Design:** I can create apps that are actually useful and easy to use
4. **Critical Thinking:** I can analyze data, identify patterns, and think about bias
5. **Documentation:** I can write clear, well-commented code that others can understand

## Key Success Factors

### For Each Assignment:
- ✅ **Meaningful Analysis:** Choose relationships that reveal real insights
- ✅ **Clear Justification:** Explain every decision I make
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing:** Test all functionality thoroughly
- ✅ **Professional Code:** Well-organized, commented, and error-free
- ✅ **User Experience:** Intuitive and helpful for users

### My Approach:
1. **Start Early:** These assignments require significant time and testing
2. **Test Thoroughly:** Test each feature as I implement it
3. **Document Everything:** Comments should explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. **Plan Before Coding:** Sketch out my approach before writing code
5. **Use External Resources Wisely:** Only for specific syntax, not complete solutions
6. **Submit Early:** Don't wait until the last minute

## Getting Help

If I encounter issues:
1. Check the code.org documentation
2. Review error messages carefully
3. Test small pieces of code individually
4. Ask specific questions about the problem
5. Make sure I understand the requirements before implementing

## My Commitment

I'm committed to:
- Creating high-quality, well-documented code
- Demonstrating mastery of all programming concepts
- Building apps that are actually useful
- Learning from each assignment and improving my skills
- Meeting all requirements with attention to detail

This repository represents my journey through CSP and my commitment to learning programming properly. Each assignment builds on the previous one, showing my growth as a programmer and my ability to create meaningful applications.

**Good luck to me on these assignments!** 🚀
